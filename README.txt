Morgan,
  I had good time doing this exercise. The following are my thoughts, assumptions, and notes:

1) This is Winform Application. I was having some trouble create Windows Universial Application
due machine and Visual .Net 2015. I am sure I could've done it but it been while and I wanted to
 give you some solution.

2) For UI to display metrics as report in real time, I use simple textbox. I wanted to use GridV
iew but as mentioned I already spend lot of time and I wanted to give you something to look at i
t.

3) I created this application using Visual 2015 with 4.6.1 framework.

4) This application creates .csv file in the same location as executable program

5) If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to re:ach out.
